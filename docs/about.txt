DECENTRALIZED BANKING, PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS & SECURE MESSAGING


{ What's UltraNote? }

UltraNote is a decentralized blockchain, with deposits function paying interest rates up to 3% per year without involvement of financial institutions, powered by 100% open source code.

UltraNote enables untraceable and anonymous messaging with file transfers up to 100Mb, and a secure way to transfer funds. Using a distributed public ledger, the sender and receiver are kept anonymous, a key concern in a post Snowden world. Hackers cannot trace money or messages when the messages are sent across public networks.

UltraNote Cryptocurrency (XUNI) is based on the Cryptonote protocol and runs on a secure peer-to-peer network technology to operate with no central authority. You control the private keys to your funds.

UltraNote is accessible by anyone in the world regardless of their geographic location or status. Our blockchain is resistant to any kind of analysis. All your XUNI transactions and messages are anonymous.

UltraNote avoids many concerns, e.g. technological, environment impact, reputational and security, of Bitcoin, and provides a glimpse of the future.

UltraNote is open-source, community driven and truly decentralized.

No one owns UltraNote, everyone can take part.
